# SPA based on Events 

This Single Page App(SPA) serves like **Event calendar** where you can check what events will be coming in the future. 
This SPA is not only for reviewing but what's awesome about it, is that everyone that wants to plan a party for 
the general public, can add their own event to it! If you looking for a specific event, you can just type 
an **event name in the searchbar** or just check a **checkbox searching** on type of event.

## Features

- **Searchbar**: If you're looking for a specific event, just type in the name.
- **Checkbox**: Look for the type of event that fits your mood by checking the specific box.
- **Code Formatting**: Automatically format your code according to best practices.
- **Code Navigation**: Use the symbol tree in the Outline view to navigate your Markdown files.
